Modelling the large-scale structure of the universe using an N-body simulation.

Proposal:
 
The first goal of this project is to collect public data of the large-scale structure of the universe. The data will then be plotted to see the clustering of galaxies in our universe. In order to understand this clustering, we will simulate the large-scale structure of our universe using a standard computational tool called the particle mesh method. This method is a type of N-body simulation. The method treats galaxies as particles interacting via the gravitational force. A system of differential equations can be set up to model the time evolution of these particles and can be solved using the Range Kutta 4 method. We will compare our simulation results to empirical reality in a number of different ways. We will plot our simulation results for the distribution of galaxies in space and the spatial auto-correlation function will be plotted as well as the power spectrum of the results. Each of these will in turn be compared with empirical reality.
